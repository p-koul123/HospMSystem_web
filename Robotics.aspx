                    <span lang="EN-IN">Robotic Surgery consists of using a robotic surgical system 
                    to perform operations on patients. Similar to minimally invasive surgery, it can 
                    be done solely or it can be performed alongside traditional open surgical 
                    procedure as well depending on the situation at hand. The Da Vinci system is the 
                    most used robotic system over the world. It consists of three components - the 
                    surgeon’s console, a patient cart, and the vision cart. All of these components 
                    work together to allow the surgeon to view what is happening and then mimics the 
                    moments to guide the instruments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
                <p>
                    <span lang="EN-IN">The surgeon’s console is the place where the surgeon sits. 
                    This is the area where he sees what is happening and has master control of how 
                    the instruments need to move. He can view high-definition real-time 3D images at 
                    the console. The patient cart is kept next to the patient’s bed where he is 
                    being operated on. The patient cart holds the camera and the instruments that 
                    are required for the surgery. The vision cart is the third component that is in 
                    charge of enabling the communication to take place seamlessly between all the 
                    components. The components of different surgical systems may vary depending on 
                    the particular system.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                    <span lang="EN-IN">Robotic Surgery history dates back to the 1980s. In 1985, 
                    PUMA 560, was the first robotic surgical system that was used for the 
                    stereotaxic operation. Then, in 1988, PROBOT was used to perform transurethral&nbsp;<a

                    In 1992, ROBODOC was developed for femur cavity preparation. In the 1990s, when 
                    laparoscopic surgery started, minimally invasive surgery was introduced. Three 
                    systems were created by this time; Da Vinci surgical system, Zeus and AESOP 
                    Robotic Surgical systems. Da Vinci surgical system was developed by Intuitive 
                    Surgical Inc. and the AESOP and Zeus systems were developed by Computer Motion.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

                    <span lang="EN-IN">Robotic prostate surgery makes use of smaller incisions to 
                    get the job done and this leads to much faster recovery time for patients. In 
                    conventional open surgery, a large incision is made in the abdomen of the 
                    patient. Through this, the surgery is performed while ensuring that the blood 
                    vessels and nerves are not damaged in the process. Robotic prostate surgery 
                    gives a more promising result since the chances of damage to delicate areas are 
                    less in this case. Moreover, surgery with a robotic surgical system is more 
                    precise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                    <span lang="EN-IN">Robotic kidney surgery might be required when one kidney or a 
                    part of a kidney needs to be removed. In traditional open surgery, a large 
                    incision, up to eight inches, might be required in order for the surgery to be 
                    performed. However, when Robotic Surgery is performed, the size of the incisions 
                    is much smaller and it is a minimally invasive procedure. Robotic kidney surgery 
                    for kidney conditions allows faster time for the body to heal and patients can 
                    resume daily activities in a comparatively short span of time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                    <span lang="EN-IN">Robotic gynaecological surgery means less pain after surgery 
                    and lesser blood loss. In traditional surgery, there is significant pain 
                    involved in any gynaecological surgery and there is usually physical trauma 
                    connected to the surgery as well. Moreover, large incisions are made in open 
                    surgery and this means longer recovery process. With Robotic Surgery, the 
                    incisions are much smaller and the recovery times are fewer which is a 
                    favourable situation compared to open surgery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                    <span lang="EN-IN">Robotic gallbladder surgery includes cholecystectomy which 
                    means removing the gallbladder. With the help of robotic surgical systems, 
                    surgeons can now perform the surgery with a single incision. This means fewer 
                    scars and the healing time is much lesser because of the lesser loss of blood 
                    compared to open surgery. Gallbladder surgery with robotic surgical systems is 
                    more beneficial to the patient as they can return to work much faster than if 
                    they had conventional open surgery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                    <span lang="EN-IN">Robotic colorectal surgery might be required in the case when 
                    a patient requires colectomy or has other conditions such as a benign tumour. 
                    Using robotic surgical systems, surgeons can better perform colon surgeries that 
                    were deemed impossible in the past. Smaller incisions and other benefits ensure 
                    that the nerves are not damaged when the surgery is being performed. In 
                    addition, tissue cutting is made a lot easier with robotic surgical systems 
                    since the view is much better and the precision is top-notch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                    treatment that they require. Since Robotic Surgery is being used now more than 
                    ever, there are certain people that it may not be right for depending on their 
                    individual case. You and your doctor need to discuss in detail whether the 
                    Robotic Surgery is right for you or not. Your doctor is the one who will 
                    ultimately decide whether you are a good candidate for Robotic Surgery or not as 
                    he will know about your medical history too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
