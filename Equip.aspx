            <span lang="EN-IN">Diagnostic medical equipment is any type of equipment or 
            tools used in a hospital setting for the sole purpose of diagnosing a patient’s 
            condition. Based on the symptoms described by the patient, a diagnostic test is 
            performed using the appropriate equipment to evaluate the patient internally. 
            The doctor or technician is looking for any abnormalities in the affected organs 
            or parts of the body that are causing the symptoms to be exhibited.</span></p>
        
            <div>Medical imaging machines – Medical imaging 
                is a type of technology that is used to create visual representations of the 
                human body’s interior. The visual image produced by the equipment is used for 
                clinical analysis and medical intervention. There are many medical imaging 
                equipment, such as radiography (X-ray machine), computed tomography (CT scan), 
                magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan), ultrasound, and echocardiography, to name 
                a few.</div>
            <div>Aside from medical imaging machines, there 
                are other medical devices used for diagnosing patients. Some examples include 
                patient scales, stethoscopes, dopplers, and pulse oximetry.<br />

            <span lang="EN-IN">This type of medical equipment is used mainly for providing 
            therapeutic benefits for certain conditions or illnesses. The use of this 
            equipment must be prescribed by a physician, which is designed to serve a 
            medical purpose. It is a long-term and reusable device that can be used in the 
            hospital or at home for patient care. There are several types of durable medical 
            equipment such as the following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            <span lang="EN-IN">The term ‘durable’ is derived from the fact that these types 
            of equipment have been tested for quality. They are designed to provide support 
            for the safety and comfort of the patients. They should be able to deliver just 
            that. Some of the common features of durable medical equipment include non-slip 
            features and load-bearing strength. Since this equipment is prescribed by the 
            physician for the benefit of the patient, the cost of acquiring one is often 
            covered by health insurance plans.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            device or tool that is designed to treat a specific condition. It 
            utilizes modern technology in order to address any abnormalities to restore 
            function in the affected organs or tissues within the body. This can also 
            include the surgical supplies designed to provide treatment for certain 
            conditions that require surgical intervention.</p>
        <span lang="EN-IN">Below are common examples of medical treatment equipment that 
            you will find in hospitals and clinics:<o:p><br />
        </o:p></span>Infusion Pumps – This type of treatment 
                equipment is used in a hospital setting. It is designed to infuse medication, 
                fluids, and other forms of treatment to the patient’s circulatory system. This 
                machine is used intravenously but you can also find epidural or arterial 
                infusions. This machine is reliable because it injects controlled amounts of 
                fluids into the patient’s system over a given period of time.<br />
           LASIK Surgical Machines – The use of LASIK technology is used primarily for the treatment of eye conditions. It is designed 
                for use on patients suffering from myopia, hyperopia, or astigmatism.
            Medical Lasers – The laser is a revolutionary technology introduced in the medical field for the treatment of 
                various medical conditions. It is a device that emits a wavelength of 
                electromagnetic radiation for clinical applications.&nbsp;

        As the name implies, life support equipment are those medical 
            devices intended to maintain the bodily function of a patient. Without life 
            support, it will be difficult for the patient’s organ systems to function on 
            their own. There are a variety of life support machines in the medical field 
            today, such as the following:Heart-lung Machines – Also known as 
                cardiopulmonary bypass (CB) devices, this type of equipment temporarily 
                functions as the heart or lungs of a patient during surgery.</span></div>

        <li class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-IN">Medical Ventilators – This type of device 
                is designed to move breathable air in and out of the lungs. It is used on 
                patients who have difficulty breathing, or who are incapable of delivering an 
                adequate supply of oxygen throughout the body. There are two types of medical 
                ventilators. One is hand-operated using a bag valve mask. The other is run and 
                operated by a computer. You will find this machine used in intensive care unit 
                patients or home care patients.<o:p></o:p></span></li>
